# How I want you to write code
- Snake case variables and functions. Functions should have the first letter of each word capitalized
- example: 
    - function: def Unpack_Synthetic_Data()
    - variable: output_file_name

for readability
- functions should have 2 line breaks between them for readability
- for loops are not allowed to be 1 line, they should be written out in full 
- if / else statements are not allowed to be 1 line, they should written out in full
- any mutli-line comments should use ''' instead of """ quotes
